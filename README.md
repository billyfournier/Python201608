# Python201608
Welcome to Coding Dojo's Python Cohort for August 2016

To get started, you need a git. Unless you have a particular affinity for the terminal, you might also want to check out a git user interface, such as [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). After downloading and installing it, clone our class repo (this one).

**Henceforth, all code reviews and comments will be made through this repo as opposed to the submission option on the learning platform**. There are two main reasons for this; the first is that it'll get you very familiarized with git. At the Dojo, we only cover git for a portion of a day during Web Fundamentals (which most of you slept through =). When you graduate, you need to know how to use it comfortably and proficiently, otherwise you'll be the laughing stock of the town.

The second reason is that I like GitHub's social aspect, which will allow me to add comments into your code, have you correct your code, keep source control so you can see the evolution of your own progress, and again--get very familiar with pull requests, pushing, and merge conflict errors.

## Getting Started

 * Clone this repo
 * Inside of your local copy, create a new folder called 'LastnameFirstName', of course replacing it with your actual name. I'll show you all how to do this in class
 * Inside of your folder, you need to have two additional folders. One called 'Algorithms', and the other called 'Assignments'.
 * **Every.Single.Damn.Day** I want you to commit your class assignments so I can keep track your _daily_ progress. Also after doing the morning algorithms during the week, type up your assignment into the example JS HTML page I've provided and submit that too.
 * Your belt exams will not be submitted on this page.
 * If you're really smart, you'll also set up your own gut repo and host it on GitHub, so you can have your own local copy of your code publicly available. This is one of the things companies look at when weeding out candidates before interviewing _hint hint_. You might even want to link to your GitHub account from your LinkedIn.
